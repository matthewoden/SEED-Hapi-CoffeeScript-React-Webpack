# Starter Kit - Build a Hapi-little-UI

Coming soon: Build a Hapi-little-API

At home, I typically use:
 * wrote custom css, with sass/postcss
 * hapi on the server
 * babel/es6/react on the client.
 * a lot of react

At work, I typically use:
 * a whole lot of bootstrap, and less
 * express on the server
 * coffeescript/cjsx/react on the client

Context switching was a little annoying, but I wanted to keep some of my own technology preferences. Thus a project seed was born.

Production rigging is totally not ready.

## Local usage:
` npm run start`

## Test
`npm run test`
