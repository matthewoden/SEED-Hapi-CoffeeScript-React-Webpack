# Starter Kit - Hapi+CoffeeScript+React+Webpack

At home, I typically use:
 * wrote custom css, with sass/postcss
 * used hapi on the server
 * wrote in es6 with babel.
 * a lot of react

At work, I typically use:
 * a whole lot of bootstrap, and less
 * express on the server
 * coffeescript/cjsx
 * a lot of react

Context switching was a little annoying, but I wanted to keep some of my own technology preferences. Thus a project seed was born.

Production rigging is totally not ready.

## Local usage:
` npm run dev`

## Production usage:
`npm run start`
(eventually pm2)

## Test
`npm run test`
